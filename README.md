Hello there, I am a backend developer with more than 4 years experience. I have good experience in web development and writing code cleanly and neatly is my habit too.

I specialize in building and maintaining web applications using Laravel. I am skilled in managing MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, as well as creating and integrating RESTful APIs. My focus is on optimizing application performance through caching and database optimization, and ensuring data security. 

Recently I am diving into Golang. I really like challenges and always learn new things.
