Hello there, I am a backend developer with more than 4 years experience. I have good experience in web development and writing code cleanly and neatly is my habit too.

I specialize in building and maintaining web applications using Laravel. I am skilled in managing MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, as well as creating and integrating RESTful APIs. My focus is on optimizing application performance through caching and database optimization, and ensuring data security. 

My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

Recently I tried to dive into Golang. I really like challenges and always learning new things.
